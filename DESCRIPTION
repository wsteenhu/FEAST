Description: A major challenge of analyzing the compositional 
    structure of microbiome data is identifying its potential origins. 
    Here, we introduce fast expectation-maximization microbial source 
    tracking (FEAST), a ready-to-use scalable framework that can 
    simultaneously estimate the contribution of thousands of potential 
    source environments in a timely manner, thereby helping unravel the 
    origins of complex microbial communities. The information gained from 
    FEAST may provide insight into quantifying contamination, tracking the 
    formation of developing microbial communities, as well as distinguishing 
    and characterizing bacteria-related health conditions.
